# Project Name: Awesome books Project 

Description of the project:

This is a page created to fulfill Microverse Awesome books project for Module 2. The project is a simple website that displays a list of books and allows you to add and remove books from that list. It must be done using JavaScript and a medium-fidelity wireframe to build the UI.

The whole project consist of following 3 partial projects:

Project 1: Manage books collection (plain JS with objects).
Project 2: Manage books collection (plain JS with classes) and add basic CSS.
Project 3: Create a complete website with navigation.

The project has to be done with pair programming.


Instructions for the Project 1:

- Implement only a basic UI with plain HTML
- Create a collection that keeps a list of books (hint: you can use an array of objects for that).
- Create a function to add a new book to the collection, with title and author.
- Create a function to remove a book from the collection (hint: you can use the array filter() method).
- Display all books saved in the collection in the top part of the page.
- Make sure that when a user clicks the "Add" button:
- A new book is added to the collection.
- The new book is displayed in the page.
- Make sure that when a user clicks the "Remove" button:
- The correct book is removed from the collection.
- The correct book dissapears from the page.
- Make sure that data is preserved in the browser's memory by using localStorage.
- To debug your application, you can use console.log(). Remember to remove debugging code before pushing your code to the remote repository.
- Don't use any library or framework, use only plain JavaScript.
